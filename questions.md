### Questions:
-	Medical details?
-	Stock details? Current price?
-	Confirm start date

### Concerns:
-	From 2016: - Expensive health insurance. A family plan will cost between 7K - 12K / year with ~$4K deductible. The company covers basic healthcare for the employee but the overall cost is still much, much higher than at other companies

### Hard work:
-	2019: Not a good fit for someone who doesn't like change - prioritization is a fundamental skill at Root, and both management and employees are encouraged to focus and prioritize only the most valuable project at any given time.
-	2018: The work load can be heavy at times, but I believe the right people and plans are in place to resolve this issue.
-	2018: For some hard work can be a con
-	2018: Building a new product can often be challenging, ambiguous work that changes rapidly. Working here takes initiative and drive that some people might not be used to. The team is not afraid to experiment and iterate on pieces of the product, so if you are used to being in an environment where making mistakes or trying things out is frowned upon, or people are comfortable with the status quo, this may be a bit of a culture shock. Also if you're used to a very "polite" environment where there is no dissent or challenging of ideas, Root will also be very different (we're nice to each other, but we'll tell it like it is and think challenging ideas makes for far better solutions as we tackle important challenges).
-	2018: If continuous growth and ambitious product goals aren't the type of environment you thrive in, this isn't the best fit for you.
-	2017: If you like firing nerf guns or playing ping pong during the workday, Root isn't for you. Expectations are realistic - you can work 40 hours a week with no complaints - but this is a very "heads down" work environment. Almost all of the discussion in the office is around business and programming related issues - no chit chat. If you are genuinely interested in producing the highest quality software, these are pros, not cons, but it could come as a culture shock to some people.
-	2017: Like any small company it takes some drive to work here.
-	2017: Root supports a great work/life balance, but while we're in the office, we get work done. Fun little side conversations do pop up periodically, but it's far more focused than most work environments. Some people aren't used to working 40 hours a week, despite spending 40 hours a week in an office. If you like lazily drifting through a work week, this won't be the best environment for you.
