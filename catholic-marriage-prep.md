  1. “Your Holiness, many today think that life-long fidelity is too challenging; many feel that the struggle to live together may be beautiful, enchanting, but it is difficult, even impossible. We ask you for a word to enlighten us on this”.
    - "True love is the love that comes from God"
    - "How does one cure the fear of the 'forever'?...day by day"
    - "The Lord can multiply your love"
    - We need to repeat this prayer: "Lord give us this day our daily love."
  2. “Your Holiness, every day life together is beautiful, it gives joy, and support. But it is a challenge to face. We believe that we need to learn how to love one another. There is a “style” of life as a couple, a spirituality of daily life that we want to take on. Can you help us in this Holy Father?”
    - We must remember these 3 phrases:
    - May I? - courtesy kindles love
    - Thank you - remember that the other person is a gft from God
    - I'm sorry - never let the sun go down without making peace
  3. “Your Holiness, in these months we are preparing for our wedding. Can you give us some advice on how to celebrate our marriage well?”
    - "That which makes your wedding full and profoundly true will be the presence of the Lord who reveals himself and gives his grace"
    - "Make it so that, like the wine in Cana, the exterior signs of your [wedding] celebration reveal the Lord's presence and remind you and everyone present of the origin and the reason for your joy, [the Lord's blessing on your love]"

### Dr. Timothy O'Malley - The Nuptial Mystery: Divine Love and Human Salvation
[Dr. Timothy O'Malley](http://theology.nd.edu/people/concurrent-and-adjunct-faculty/timothy-omalley/) is the Directory of the [Notre Dame Center for Liturgy](http://liturgy.nd.edu/). Dr. O'Malley is a former professor of mine, and shared with me the syllabus for a course he taught (fall 2016) on marriage entitled "The Nuptial Mystery: Divine Love and Human Salvation." 

* [Course Description](https://class-search.nd.edu/reg/srch/ClassSearchServlet?CRN=20652&TERM=201610&P=401094): 

> "This course introduces students to the study of theology through attention to the sacrament of marriage. The structure of the course, drawn from the rite of marriage, seeks to understand the nature of divine and human love and how this love is salvific for the human person. The course, grounded in historical study, will introduce students to major sources for Christian theology. The class will treat themes related to a natural theology of love; the understanding of God as lover within the Scriptures and the Tradition; sexual ethics and a theology of family life; and, a spirituality of marriage in the modern age."

* [Course Books](http://www.bkstr.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/booklookServlet?bookstore_id-1=700&term_id-1=201610&div-1=&dept-1=THEO&course-1=20425&section-1=01)

I did not complete the full reading for the course, but found several books and essays helpful.

  - Conjugal love is not an illusion: love is the "melting of the soul"
  - Being in love is an element of conjugal love
  - Polygamy is essentially contrary to conjugal love
  - Conjugal exclusiveness differs from possessiveness
  - Marriage is more than conjugal love
  - Marriage creates an objective bond, which unites the spouses
  - Marriage comes from a free decision
  - Marriage is exclusive and irrevocable; it involves ultimate intimacy and surrender
  - Love is the meaning of sexual union
  - Procreation and the communion of love must never deliberately be separated
  - Childless marriages may thonetheless fulfil the ideal of marriage
  - Every marriage filled with love is fruitful
  - Only marriage justifies physical union
  - Loe must be nourished in every marriage
  - Love's task in the best of marriages: never lose the sense of wonderful mystery 
  - Love's task in imperfect marriages: try to see the other in the highest light
  - Love's task in troubled marriages: sacrifice and renunciation in the care for the salvation of the other
  - Each marriage has its own particular task
  - Sacramental marriage transfigures natural marriage, and offers the highest and noblest earthly happiness
  - Christian conjugal love sees the beloved as an image of God

  - Sacramentally, marriage is like Holy Orders

  - The indissolubility of marriage arises from its intrinsic sublimity
  - Conjugal love seeks the indissolubility of marriage
  - Irrevocable self-giving fulfils conjugal love
  - Conjugal love requires a heroic spirit: all great things on earth are connected with risk
  - Mutual love is the proper motive for marriage: to lead to the eternal welfare of both souses
  - Other motives are sometimes permissible (deep esteem for each other and formation of a noble community life)
  - Unworthy or reprehensible motives for marriage do not justify it, but can be transformed into love that glorifies God
  - Only a marriage motivated by love is reasonable
  - Marriage is the highest of human communities: it involves the person in his whole nature
  - Marriage is greater than the nation or the state
  - Christian marriage directly glorifies God
  - Sacramental marriage quickens love of Jesus
  - Yet consecrated virginity is superior to marriage: it is marriage with Jesus Himself
